title: Hope you know JS
value: 400
description: For this challenge, once you deploy an instance - you will see a webserver with 2 files: `flag_prefix.txt` and `good-luck.js`.

Your challenge is to reverse `good-luck.js` to get the missing piece of the flag. Once you solved it, your flag format is `flag_prefix+good-luck-solution`.

For example, if your flag prefix is `11:22:` and you solved `good-luck.js` to give you `327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc`. Then your flag to submit is `11:22:327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc`.

Note: `flag_prefix.txt` is unrelated to the challenge. Please do not factor this in when reversing `good-luck.js`.

Good luck! We hope you know your JavaScript ;)
