This iteration is based off the previous version, but a change has been made to make it even harder to decrypt the victimized files.\r\n\r\nAnalyze the artifacts and decrypt the DEADFACE file that was encrypted with this version of the cryptoware binary.\r\n\r\nEnter the flag like this: `flag{here-is-the-answer}`.\r\n\r\nNOTE: These files are DIFFERENT from those in the first four RansomWar challenges!\r\n\r\n[DarkAngel Encrypter 04](https://tinyurl.com/yja2dk8c)\r\n\r\n[DarkAngel Decrypter 04](https://tinyurl.com/2jhsztew)\r\n\r\n[Encrypted File 01](https://tinyurl.com/ycxrr8d7)\r\n\r\n[Calling Card](https://tinyurl.com/73afzp8a)\r\n\r\n> HINT: The Dark Angel ransomware operates only on files in the current directory that have an extension of `.dface`, which is used exclusively by DEADFACE acolytes.\r\n\r\n> HINT2: THIS IS VERY IMPORANT... WHEN TRYING TO DECRYPT THESE CHALLENGE FILES, MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE ONLY *.rtoqs FILES IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY!!!
