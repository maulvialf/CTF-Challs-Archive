          <p><p>I wrote this awesome binary-JSON to JSON converter, but I can't find the source anymore :(( I only
have the binary built for RISC-V, so I had to write a RISC-V JIT to run it. Plz hack both!!</p>
<p>This is the first stage of <code>riscv-b2json</code> and <code>riscv-jit</code>. The challenge files and connection are
the same for both challenges.</p>
