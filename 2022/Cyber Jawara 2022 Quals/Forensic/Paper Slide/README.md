## Description
>b"Someone handed me a paper-like document. A man had said that theres something beneath it. He also said that the creator of the document didnt really care about its security, so that he ended up using a mere random number password in the process."

**Hint**
* b"I felt that theres something off about this document, to the point that the PDF objects cant be rendered properly, including the decryption process. This thing happened, after he decided to nullify all of the documents catalog where the page resides\n* He secretly said therere two kinds of password, which are password of pages and an old archive. Each of them were considered to be different. To be precise, the old archive password is not crackable, but can only be obtained after decrypting the pages\n* Do you know that a PDF page can be `overrided` over and over again in a simple manner? This term is applies to this document. The creator thought that it would be nice to fit all of things into a `single page`"
