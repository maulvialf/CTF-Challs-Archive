title: BFS
value: 500
description: You are given an unweighted graph with <var>N</var> nodes and <var>K</var> edges. Let <var>P</var> and <var>Q</var> be two nodes in the graph. You are asked to find the shortest path between the two nodes.

**Input** <br>
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer <var>T</var> - the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of the input contains two unsigned integers <var>N</var>  and <var>K</var> - the number of nodes and edges respectedly.

Each of the next <var>K</var> lines contains two unsigned integers <var>V</var> and <var>U</var> - the description of an edge.

The last line contains two unsigned integers <var>P</var> and <var>Q</var> - the to and from nodes.
