title: Broken Converter
value: 100
description: Miku has finally finished her assignment and is ready to submit – but for some reason, the school requires all assignments to be submitted as `.xps` files. Miku found a converter online and used the converted file for submission. The file looked good at first, but it seems as if there’s something broken in the converter. Can you help her figure out what is wrong?
