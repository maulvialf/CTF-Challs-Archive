>b"Last week was a mess. My website got hacked, and the hacker managed to get all of my user information. Worst of all, the hacker managed to get my precious flag. Im super pissed about it. But today, it will be different. I fixed the feature, and Im sure that its secure. Yeah.. Im really sure about it. I also hired a developer to add new features to the website. One of them is to vote for your favorites author! Im excited to show it to you. My developer said it wasnt finished yet, but I dont really care! I trust that guy. Oh, I also added a thank you page this time btw. All right, dont forget to vote for your favorite author!\r\n\r\nAuthor: Shatternox#1668"
