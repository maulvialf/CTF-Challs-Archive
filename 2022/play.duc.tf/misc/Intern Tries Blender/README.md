title: Intern Tries Blender
value: 499
description: Yeaaaah mate, listen, we thought it would be cool to give out little 3D printed flags last year, so we had the intern take a crack at blender.. Lemme tell you mate, mistake.

So anyway, if you could take what they've done with this blender extension and get us our old flag back that'd be great.

It should just be as simple as clicking the generate flag option, the intern keeps mentioning a sidebar but all I can find is a boomerang...

Flag format: `DUCTF{fl4G}`, no spaces.

Note: The attachment has been updated (24/09/2022 8:50 PM AEST) to change the Blender version of the extension to 3.2 from 2.8. This doesn't affect the challenge much and has only been updated for clarity.
