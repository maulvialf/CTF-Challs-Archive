Last year, Luciafer attempted, and TheZeal0t succeeded, in encrypting a large number of Lytton Lab\s sensitive files with cryptoware.\r\n\r\nBut the mercenary hacker, CODENAME "Dark Angel" isn\t going to sit idly by and be played a fool by DEADFACE! Oh, NO! DarkAngel has also created cryptoware that he / she hash unleashed on DEADFACE. After DEADFACE, it is likely that DarkAngel will attempt to target Turbo Tactical as well.\r\n\r\nWe managed to get copies of Dark Angel\s ransomware, along with some encrypted files and artifacts produced by the malware. The encrypted files were passed to us by our contact inside DEADFACE.\r\n\r\nWe need your help analyzing the cryptoware. The following artifacts will be required for the following challenges:\r\n\r\n* RansomWAR 1 - Let\s HASH This Out, Fellas!\r\n* RansomWAR 2 - Indicators of YOU\RE HOSED!\r\n* RansomWAR 3 - Hidden in PLAIN(TEXT) Sight\r\n* RansomWAR 4 - OFFCON3\r\n\r\n> [DarkAngel Encrypter 03](https://tinyurl.com/mrhy9em7)<br>\r\n> [DarkAngel Decrypter 03](https://tinyurl.com/2prbddyd)<br>\r\n> [Encrypted File 01](https://tinyurl.com/2s3wjau6)<br>\r\n> [Encrypted File 02](https://tinyurl.com/2sesmfjx)<br>\r\n> [Encrypted File 03](https://tinyurl.com/yf5w9ru5)<br>\r\n> [Calling Card](https://tinyurl.com/2p8y4ksc)<br>\r\n\r\nThere will be different artifacts for RANSOMWAR 5 - OFFCON 4, which is the final version that was unleashed on DEADFACE.\r\n\r\nHINT: The Dark Angel ransomware operates only on files in the **current directory** that have an extension of `.dface`, which is used exclusively by DEADFACE members.  All other file extensions and directories are ignored by this ransomware.\r\n\r\nRansomWAR 1 Challenge 1 - Obtain the SHA512 hash of the DarkAngel Encryptor program (Windows version).  Enter the flag as the first eight hex digits, a colon (":"), and the last eight digits of the SHA512 hash, in lower case, as follows:\r\n\r\n`flag{aabbccdd:eeff0011}`
