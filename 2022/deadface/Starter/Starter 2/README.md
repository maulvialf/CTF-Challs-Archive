## Description
>**IMPORTANT**\r\n\r\nIf you are a US-based team competing for a cash prize, you ***MUST*** associate your team\s country with "United States". This is how we will determine which teams win cash prizes at the end of an event. Once the event is officially over, we will tally the scores. If your team was not marked as a US team prior to the event ending, you ***WILL NOT*** qualify for one of the cash prizes.\r\n\r\nPlease enter the following flag to acknowledge this information: `flag{cash_prizes}`.
