## Description
><sup>Created by: <b>omicronjob</b></sup>\r\n\r\nA NETGEAR router in the main library of Eastern State University was hacked, leading to a prolonged man-in-the-middle attack and student passwords getting swiped. The network admin cannot remember how to log into the router\xe2\x80\x99s admin portal to change the password and review the logs. He does not remember the WPA key to log in. He also thinks the default wpa keys were never changed. Here was the hash he found: \r\n\r\n`4be29bb887c260061afb229d81d250a05f92fa59e324cc16fa7ae2fd3fadd1a9`\r\n\r\nCan you find out what the wpa keys were?\r\nAssume the key is not salted due to the age of the NETGEAR router.\r\n\r\nEnter the answer as `flag{password}`.
