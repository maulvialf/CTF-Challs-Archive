We hope they run stable now, but in the worst case we might need to change our setup again. Please don't tax our infrastructure too hard, thanks!*\r\n\r\nI was at the High Roller Casino, playing my favorite game \u2013 Doppelkopf. I was on a winning streak, raking in chips left and right. But as the night wore on, I started to get tired. I needed to take a break, but I didn't want to lose my place at the table.\r\n\r\nThat's when I remembered my personal Etherpad instance. I had been using it to keep track of my Doppelkopf strategies and tactics. I could log into my Etherpad account and review my notes, refreshing my memory and giving me the edge I needed to continue my winning streak.\r\n\r\nBut when I tried to log in, I realized that I had forgotten my username. I still knew that my password was `kitctf`. But without my username, I wouldn't be able to access my Etherpad account and my valuable notes, and as I had not yet set up accounts for my fellow players, it was my only hope.\r\n\r\nThat was when I met you.\r\nCan you help me recover my notes?\r\nI have attached the configuration of my Etherpad instance.\r\n\r\n_Note: The server is running [Etherpad 1.8.18](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/tree/1.8.18) with [ep_ldapauth 0.4.0](https://github.com/tykeal/ep_ldapauth/tree/42cd54c8f65ebb4b4c061b682be2acaf5486e0bc)._",
