## Description
>b"*Update 2022-12-10T01:57:34+00:00: The Etherpad challenges are back up now. If you think you notice anything strange, please let us know. We hope they run stable now, but in the worst case we might need to change our setup again. Please dont tax our infrastructure too hard, thanks!*\r\n\r\nI was at the High Roller Casino, playing my favorite game \xe2\x80\x93 Doppelkopf. I was on a winning streak, raking in chips left and right. But as the night wore on, I started to get tired. I needed to take a break, but I didnt want to lose my place at the table.\r\n\r\nThats when I remembered my personal Etherpad instance. I had been using it to keep track of my Doppelkopf strategies and tactics. I could log into my Etherpad account and review my notes, refreshing my memory and giving me the edge I needed to continue my winning streak.\r\n\r\nBut when I tried to log in, I realized that I had forgotten my username. I still knew that my password was `kitctf`. But without my username, I wouldnt be able to access my Etherpad account and my valuable notes, and as I had not yet set up accounts for my fellow players, it was my only hope.\r\n\r\nThat was when I met you.\r\nCan you help me recover my notes?\r\nI have attached the configuration of my Etherpad instance.\r\n\r\n_Note: The server is running [Etherpad 1.8.18](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/tree/1.8.18) with [ep_ldapauth 0.4.0](https://github.com/tykeal/ep_ldapauth/tree/42cd54c8f65ebb4b4c061b682be2acaf5486e0bc)._"
