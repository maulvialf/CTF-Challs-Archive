## Description
>I used to play a game back then, the game now has an upcoming REmake.\r\nThere\s this one girl in the game who loves to wear Red Gown, she said she was asked on a date by the main character!\r\nBut she said that she\s a bit concern because some people said the main character posted something weird on his profile account on a certain bird social media, but unfortunately he already deleted the post.  Can you help her find out that "something weird" they\ve been talking about?\r\n\r\nAnyway, contact her on her secret phone number if you found it:\r\n+1571161997487800324\r\n\r\n```\r\nNever always trust on what you see.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Author: aimardcr`
