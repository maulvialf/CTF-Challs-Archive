description: Inspired by a recent CTF, but I made the binary much easier for you to solve.

Hint: The decompiled binary seems to look similar to [this](https://github.com/project-sekai-ctf/sekaictf-2022/blob/main/reverse/baby-chicken/challenge/chicken)...

Hint 2: There is no FFI to `C`, what remains seems to be a flag checker with a simple cipher.
