title: ECC Quiz
value: 451
description: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a method of public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Learning ECC is important for both CTFs and real-world applications. This challenge is a quiz to test your knowledge of ECC.

Note: I highly recommend reading over the [CryptoHack Course](https://cryptohack.org/courses/elliptic/course_details/) before attempting this challenge if you have no prior knowledge of ECC. You should be able to solve the challenge by understanding the course!
