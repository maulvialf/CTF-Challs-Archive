## Description
>b"X made a stateless password manager and used it for all the top sites he visited. But on observing the code he found that his key could retrieve a maximum number of states and decided to not use it because of its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not get to reset all of his passwords.\r\n\r\nWell send you the names of some websites at `nc 34.106.211.122 1222`. If you are able to find most of the passwords, well give you the flag.\r\n\r\n**MD5sum**  :  `072419cd201a7964c19a7177af1ec090  src.zip`\r\n\r\n**Author** : [ph03n1x](https://twitter.com/MeenakshiSl1) ,  [4lex1](https://twitter.com/SandhraBino)"
