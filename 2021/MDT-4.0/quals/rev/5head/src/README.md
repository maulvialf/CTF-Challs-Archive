# Mirror

Simple [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) application that plays a video of
the computer's camera at a maximized size like looking into a mirror.
Includes an optional rainbow filter effect that uses CSS animations.

## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd mirror`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Add support for saving current image to a local `.png` file.
- Support drawing directly on the mirror using the mouse.
- Add more effect and filter options.
- Add zooming.
- Add global keybinding to quickly open it.
