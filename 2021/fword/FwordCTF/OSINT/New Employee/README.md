## Description
>"Qunnoune Phrasavath" has recently started a new job. Can you find his serial number in the company he works for?\r\n\r\nFlag Format: FwordCTF{serialNumber}\r\n\r\nAuthor: `Cyb3rDoctor`

**Hint**
* b"Focus on every single detail you found (literally!). You may have focused on some obvious big parts and forgot to check the smaller ones and vice versa. (Remember, small details may be helpful sometimes). Finally, dont forget to link everything together.\n* 1.  I thought it was obvious that Im not targeting a real person in the challenge! And that means that I definitely cant get him a serial number from a real company!!! So, the company was also created by me. Dont waste your time by searching for real companies, youll only find the company name with the serial number in the last step, so focus on the details.\n\n2. The scope that I chose for this challenge fits the CTF, so its your task to identify the scope.\n\n3. Read more about SOCMINT, that may help you in some steps.\n\n4. Everything is there for a reason, so try to link everything together."
