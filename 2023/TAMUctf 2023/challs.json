As for the issue on section 3, yeah we couldn't figure out how to get output from eval so we will just have to roll with it. And for the security team, please assure them that we filter out all numbers and letters in the first round so no one can write malicious things.

Can you help me figure out what's wrong with my actixserver? I swear, I've tried everything. I got the routes right, my hosting works fine, butfor some reason, the sign endpoint just isn't working. Go on, give it a look. I've beendebugging this thing for hours but really I just can't find the solution. actix is so hardto understand sometimes. I turned on debugging. I made sure my signing algo works fine.But for whatever reason, I'm not getting any response back on that endpoint. It's sofrustrating. Why do people even do web anyways? What's the point? How am I supposed tocontinue as a respected developer when I can't even make a basic webserver? Sometimes Iwonder if I should give up programming and go make a garden. That would be nice, don't youthink? Gardening sounds like a nice break from programming and security. Hell, I bet thepay is comparable for some of those positions. Can you imagine gardening for a big companyor maybe a really wealthy person? Have one of those on-site housing sheds, like in thatNetflix series. What was it called? Oh, yeah, anyways, here's the code. Got it hosted ina scratch container at the moment. I think it's so cool that you can do that with Rust.Just compile it for musl and slam it in a container on its own. You know, I once tried todo that with some C code, but the tools are just not there to get async handling working.Go might be able to do it, but who uses that language anyways? Happy hunting.</p>",
