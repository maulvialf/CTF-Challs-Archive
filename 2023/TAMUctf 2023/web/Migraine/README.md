>b"<p>Author: <code>RougeGuardian</code>, <code>Mr. Blade</code></p><p>This challenge gave me a migraine to develop, hopefully it doesnt do the same to you.</p><pre><code>To: Acme Production Team\r\nFrom: Acme Development Team\r\nYeah were 3 weeks behind schedule and we need to push this to production. As for the issue on section 3, yeah we couldnt figure out how to get output from eval so we will just have to roll with it. And for the security team, please assure them that we filter out all numbers and letters in the first round so no one can write malicious things. I think were good to go!</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNOTE: Changes will no longer be persistent between connections."
