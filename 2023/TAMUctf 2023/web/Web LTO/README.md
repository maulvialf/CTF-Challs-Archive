## Description
>b"<p>Author: <code>Addison</code></p><p>Im trying to create a more async-optimised version of the actix multipart example. That means switching over to tokioFile, reusing file handles, and so on. I think its working great so far, and I dont think users can interact with eachother. Want to give it a try? Im already using it to store my super-secret <code>flag.txt</code> file, and it holds up pretty wellto having repeated uploads (Im testing at one upload every 10 seconds or so while I debug things!).</p><p><strong>Author note:</strong> To prevent interaction between users, this challenge is stateless. You will not be able to download anypreviously uploaded content. As a result, you may not observe files persisting between uploads and <strong>bruteforcing is not viable as a solution</strong>.</p>"
