## Description
>b"<p>Author: <code>Addison</code></p><p>I wrote a program which demonstrates how ed25519 keys can be used to sign challenges, butits not working for some reason. Can you help me figure out whats wrong with my actixserver? I swear, Ive tried everything. I got the routes right, my hosting works fine, butfor some reason, the sign endpoint just isnt working. Go on, give it a look. Ive beendebugging this thing for hours but really I just cant find the solution. actix is so hardto understand sometimes. I turned on debugging. I made sure my signing algo works fine.But for whatever reason, Im not getting any response back on that endpoint. Its sofrustrating. Why do people even do web anyways? Whats the point? How am I supposed tocontinue as a respected developer when I cant even make a basic webserver? Sometimes Iwonder if I should give up programming and go make a garden. That would be nice, dont youthink? Gardening sounds like a nice break from programming and security. Hell, I bet thepay is comparable for some of those positions. Can you imagine gardening for a big companyor maybe a really wealthy person? Have one of those on-site housing sheds, like in thatNetflix series. What was it called? Oh, yeah, anyways, heres the code. Got it hosted ina scratch container at the moment. I think its so cool that you can do that with Rust.Just compile it for musl and slam it in a container on its own. You know, I once tried todo that with some C code, but the tools are just not there to get async handling working.Go might be able to do it, but who uses that language anyways? Happy hunting.</p>"
