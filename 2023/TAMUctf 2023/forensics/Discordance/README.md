## Description
>b"<p>Author: <code>SkrubLawd</code></p><p>An admin was helping run a discord-hosted CTF and accidentally released a challenge that displayed the flag, but they were able to take it down before anyone could get it. The new challenge is way too hard and no one can solve it. All we have is the admins discord data. Can you get the flag from the originally leaked challenge?</p>\r\n<p>NOTE:  the flag format is <code>gigem{}</code></p>"
