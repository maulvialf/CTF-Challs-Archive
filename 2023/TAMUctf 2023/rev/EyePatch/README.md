## Description
>b"<p>Author: <code>RogueGuardian</code></p><p>Corporate said we were behind schedule, so we pushed our untested code to production. Unfortunately, we realized that we had some unintended bugs in our code. We need you to fix the binary before corporate gets word of this.</p><p>We narrowed down what you need to fix to 3 issues:</p><ol><li>A numerical mistype</li><li>A flipped comparison</li><li>A wrong math operation between two numbers</li></ol><p>Each issue is a single byte that needs to be changed. Note that <code>main()</code> is written as intended, just change what is in the function bodies to correct the code. Once you think you have the correct binary, uphold the file to our server at http://eyepatch.tamuctf.com, and well verify if its correct.</p>\r\n\r\nNOTE: Your binary must differ by exactly 3 bytes from the provided binary."
