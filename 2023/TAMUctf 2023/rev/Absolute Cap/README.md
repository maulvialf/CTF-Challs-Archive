## Description
><p>Author: <code>Addison</code></p><p>Look, I tried to write some flavour text for this challenge, but it\s really a straightforward blind reversingchallenge. We\ve provided you with two binaries, both present and running on the server. Connections to the server connect to the "server" binary. <strong>There are no other binaries present on the server, not even system utilities</strong>.</p><p>Breathe, step back, and enjoy a little Rust reversing. :)</p>
