# Counter-Strike Global Offensive (Aimbot) [500 pts]

**Category:** rev
**Solves:** 6

## Description
>Since Jacob wasn\t very good at the popular FPS game Counter Strike, he decided to purchase an aimbot from a shady Russian developer!\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to be doing something weird to his game. Can you figure out what it\s doing?\r\n\r\n(CS:GO is not required for this challenge, but you can download it for free on Steam)\r\n\r\n**Only 5 submissions allowed!**\r\nThe flag for this challenge can be in format "UMDCTF{flag}" or just "flag" instead.\r\n\r\nNote: If you decide to actually use this challenge in CS:GO, remember to start CS:GO with the "-insecure" flag or you risk getting banned from the game!\r\n\r\nAuthor: `Assgent`

**Hint**
* Hint 1: It looks like the shady Russian developer accidentally leaked some of his source code: https://pastebin.com/3ZTQC6wc\n\n\n* Hint 2: If you try to run this aimbot, consider patching the game title and its offsets!
