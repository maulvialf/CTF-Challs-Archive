Sally snuck into the LINE PLUS Korea office before the start of LINE CTF 2023 and managed to steal the CTF flag from one of the computers. The only clues available to solve the case are the cryptographic library that was used to send the flag to Brown and the network packet logs that were captured during that time. Find the leaked flag and prove Sally's cheating.
