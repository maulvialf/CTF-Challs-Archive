## Description
>**Description**\r\n<br>I wrote a Metamod plugin to retrieve the classname of any entities on a running Sven Co-Op game server. I have installed it on my server, but something unexpected happen and I haven\t got the time to test my plugin yet. Can you test it for me?\r\n\r\n**Container spawner**\r\n<br>http://game.hackemall.live:5000/\r\n\r\n**Game client (if you need it)** <br>https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop/\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n<br>You should research on how Metamod and Metamod plugin works, what is an "entity" in GoldSrc engine (Source Engine uses the same concept, so can refer to), what are the data structures that an entity has, the GoldSrc network protocol, etc...\r\n\r\n**File** <br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ONe7x2IFUkye7nkxgdP6tqZEob-nr88R/view?usp=share_link\r\n\r\n**Author**\r\n<br>[nyancat0131](https://twitter.com/bienpnn)
