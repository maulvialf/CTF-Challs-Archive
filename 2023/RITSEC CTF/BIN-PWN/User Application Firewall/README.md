## Description
>Created by MetaCTF\r\n\r\n<p>Our penetration testing team is just one server away from getting access to all of C3\s networks! This one\s proving to be very tough, as the only thing that\s running is their User Application Firewall. The company claims this service is hardened against any buffer overflow and other stack-based vulnerabilities. They even give you the <a href="https://metaproblems.com/858e22bc6f063b6e6738ec48289778b3/uaf">compiled binary</a>, their <a href="https://metaproblems.com/858e22bc6f063b6e6738ec48289778b3/uaf.c">source code</a> and <a href="https://metaproblems.com/858e22bc6f063b6e6738ec48289778b3/libc.so.6">libc</a> that they used to run this service! Can you break in?</p>\r\n<p>Connect to <code>host1.metaproblems.com 5600</code> to see if you can gain access to the system!  This service is running on Ubuntu 18.04.</p>\r\n\r\nNOTE: This flag\s format is MetaCTF{}
