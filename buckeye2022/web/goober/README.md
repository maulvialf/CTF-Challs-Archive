description: Javascript has built-in functionality to convert SVGs to PNGs. But Javascript is slow. You know what's fast! Golang! I created goober, the world's first online SVG to PNG converter written in Go. 

*Note: The containers are created such that `goober-public` on remote is 172.10.0.101 when running locally, and `goober-internal` on remote is 172.10.0.102 locally
