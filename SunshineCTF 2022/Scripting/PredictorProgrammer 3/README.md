## Description
># PredictorProgrammer: Sequels are all the rage!\r\n## Take that, friends and siblings!\r\n\r\nWell pooh. I give up. This one is doable. Hints are same as before.\r\n\r\nAssuming I didn\t do that I would need to give you a couple chances to get it right... But I expect you to have flawless perfection.\r\n\r\nFlag will be given by our backend in the standard `sun{}` format!\r\n\r\nVisit `nc predictor.sunshinectf.games 22203`, and play a game of predicting the ~~future~~ PAST!\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI am not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is you predict the PAST SEED with 100% accuracy.\r\n\r\nJust don\t use the previous numbers to predict the PAST state of the RNG, that would totally not be predicting the future, as the state is set from the start, so you\d be predicting the PAST! And it would _ruin_ the whole concept of this challenge and make it an exercise in math and googling how to break linear congruential generators! That\s super boring, this is _strictly_ about predicting the PAST, which is fun!\r\n\r\n## Example Usages\r\n\r\n"Hi, I\m thinking of a number from 1 to 31"\r\n```python\r\n7\r\n```\r\nWrong. Just wrong.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: In the PAST we may change the support structure if we find there\s security issues with them.\r\nwait did I just find-replace future with PAST?
