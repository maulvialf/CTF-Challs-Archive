## Description
>My avr challenge was so bad, so I decided to make a mips challenge, which is also very bad. This program can\xe2\x80\x99t even run properly for some reason lmao. But my friend can magically run the program and give the output to me. Can you figure out what input did my friend give to the program? btw I use musl.cc.\r\n\r\n**Author**: ReeyaDono
